# Enhancement_Three

Although this repository is named "Enhancement_Three", it is a new database project that wasn't derived from earlier course work at SNHU. The project uses the C# programming language and the Microsoft SQL Server Management Suite v18.10. The code that resides in this repository is the client side C# code. It's primary purpose is to create an SQL database, a database table, and populate the database table. This is only accomplished after the user is authenticated using secure authentication. The following steps are required to use this software.


1. Download and install the Microsoft SQL Server Management Suite v18.10 software (SSMS).
2. Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019.
3. Ensure administrative privilges are set for administering SSMS.
4. Create login credentials in SSMS. This same login information will be used to authenticate through the C# client side code.
5. Copy the server name in SSMS and paste it into the C# client code.
6. Compile and run the C# client side code.
7. Refresh SSMS by clicking the refresh button under Object Explorer.
